# 3D-mesh-tutorial-js


This is an exploration of Three.js and its ability to generate 3D mesh graphs, which will be used for solar array production outputs based on different azimuth and tilt inputs provided.

The goal is to have the application this will ultimately live in be completely dynamic and responsive, based on the provided inputs.
